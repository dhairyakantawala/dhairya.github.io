        <h2>Mutual Fund Terminology</h2>
        <p><strong>NAV (Net Asset Value)</strong> = (Total Assets - Total Liabilities) / Number of Outstanding Shares. NAV is like the stock price equivalent of a MF or ETF. NAV does not matter and usually investors see it but it is pointless as say if NAV is 10 and I buy 3 then I am investing 30. Similarly, if NAV is 5 and I am investing 30 then I will just buy 6 stocks.</p>

        <p><strong>Sharpe Ratio</strong> is the comparison of the return of an investment upon its underlying risk. Now there are 2 main things here, the return of investment and also the underlying risk. The return on investment is the difference of returns (percentage returns) and the risk-free returns (In India it is the 10-year government bond returns as it is considered risk-free). The risk is the standard deviation of the same return over the same time period as the deviation is the measure of risk/volatility.</p>

        <p><strong>Sortino Ratio</strong> is the same as Sharpe Ratio, the only difference is here we take the downside risk and not the actual risk. The downside risk is the standard deviation of only the negative returns. So downside risk = root of sigma(min(Ri - Rf, 0))/N.</p>

        <p><strong>Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)</strong> is just a formula as E[Ri] - Rf = beta (E[Rm] - Rf), where Ri = Returns of the portfolio, Rf is the risk-free returns and Rm is the returns of some market portfolio (In India, say Nifty). The beta is the cov(Ri, Rm)/Var(Rm), it is the risk profile, so beta more than 1 means our portfolio is more risky than the market and less than 1 means it is less risky than the market portfolio.</p>

        <p><strong>Jensen’s Alpha</strong> = Rp - [Rf + beta(Rm - Rf)] so here this means that alpha is the excess returns the portfolio gets. Rp is the portfolio’s actual return, Rf is the risk-free rate and so Rf + beta(Rm - Rf) is the expected returns of the portfolio and when we subtract it with Rp we get the excess returns a portfolio makes. So more positive alpha means that the portfolio outperformed and negative means underperformance by the CAPM model.</p>

        <p><strong>R Squared</strong> is 1 - SSr/SSt, where SSr is the sum of square of residuals, where it is sigma square of Ri - Rp where Rp is the predicted returns using some linear model. SSt is the total variance and is the sigma square of Ri - modR where modR is the mean of returns by the portfolio. R squared captures the essence of how well the portfolio ’s returns are explained by the market. If R squared is 0.82 then 82% of the portfolio’s returns are explained by the market (In India it is the Nifty index).</p>

        <p><strong>Downside and Upside Deviation</strong> is the downside risk and the upside risk (see Sortino ratio denominator). The downside deviation is the standard deviation of the returns that fall below a threshold (here it is Rf). Similarly, the upside deviation is the standard deviation of the returns that fall above a threshold (here it is Rf). A less than 5 percent means that the portfolio has excellent or minimal downside risk. A good upside deviation is 5% to 10%. More than 15 means that the portfolio is very aggressive and has significant potential for high returns.</p>

        <p><strong>Downside and Upside Capture Ratios</strong> are two very important ratios. The downside capture ratio or downside portfolio returns / downside market returns indicate how better is the downside protection of the portfolio. If this value is less than one then it means that the portfolio is doing really well when it comes to downside protection. The upside ratio is the same but for the upside returns of the portfolio / the market upside returns. A value of more than one is a good thing as it means that the portfolio is making more than the market in the upside trend.</p>

        <p><strong>AUM</strong> is the average asset under management and when we take the fund’s expense * 100 and divide by the AUM we get the expense ratio. A high expense ratio reduces the net returns for the investors and say if the fund is making 10% returns then what the investors will get at the end of 1 year is 10% - expense ratio.</p>

        <p><strong>CAGR</strong> or Compound Annual Growth Rate is how much returns we get after a year as the returns are compounded. So after say 10 days if the fund makes 2% then now instead of using 100% of what was put in, the fund uses 102% of then hopefully does the same. Here a CAGR of 15% will double the money put in after 5 years. Similarly, a CAGR value of 32% can double your money in 2.5 years.</p>

        <h2>Price & Valuation Fundamentals</h2>

        <p><strong>Current Market Price:</strong> This is called the CMP, as the name suggests, It is the current market price of a stock denoted by <strong>P_latest</strong>.</p>

        <p><strong>52-Week High/Low:</strong> This is the highest price at which the stock traded and the lowest price, by looking at this metric one gets a good idea of the volatility of the stock. If the <strong>CMP = 100</strong> and the <strong>52 high = 120</strong> and <strong>52 low = 80</strong>, then by looking at this we have a nice understanding of how the stock’s volatility is looking. Also, a stock performing near to the 52-week high is performing well, and similarly, a stock near the 52-week low is performing not well. Usually, the 52-week high and low can also be seen as support and resistance levels.</p>

        <p><strong>Market Capitalisation:</strong> The calculation of this is just <strong>CMP * no of stocks in market</strong>, but this is a very important metric. Usually, stocks more than <strong>100000 cr</strong> market cap are considered large cap. Remember that the top 100 stocks by market cap are large cap, then 100-250 are mid cap and 250 and beyond are small cap.</p>

        <p><strong>Enterprise Value:</strong> It is the total money needed to acquire 100% of the company. By looking at the market cap alone, one cannot really see how well the stock is doing. This is when the <strong>EV</strong> comes into play, <strong>EV = Market cap + debt - cash</strong>. Even though some company has a very high market cap, if it has high cash, the EV or the actual price of buying the whole company is low. Let’s say <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> have <strong>100</strong> as market cap. If <strong>A</strong> has <strong>100</strong> as debt and <strong>10</strong> as cash, then <strong>EV = 100 + 100 - 10 = 190</strong>, and say <strong>B</strong> has <strong>debt = 10</strong> and <strong>cash = 100</strong>, then <strong>EV = 10</strong>. So here, <strong>B</strong> is a less risky investment even though market cap is the same.</p>

        <p><strong>Enterprise Value per Share:</strong> So share price is <strong>market cap / total shares in market</strong>, similarly here <strong>EV / total shares in market</strong> is the <strong>EV per share</strong>. This is a better metric because EV has both debt and cash accounted for, so when the market overvalues or undervalues stocks, EV per share will give a better estimate and signal than share value.</p>

        <p><strong>Intrinsic Value:</strong> The actual value of an asset, so comparing it to the market we can tell if something is undervalued or overvalued. The model for intrinsic value calculation is complex, and mainly we use something called the <strong>discount cash flow (DCF)</strong> method to calculate this. Now this method is very interesting. Basically, say we know that for the next 10 years the cash flow is going to be <strong>200 dollars</strong>. Then for every year, we have <strong>cash flow = 200 * (1 + growth rate)^n / (1 + discount rate)^n</strong>, where the discount rate is the risk-free rate. Now after calculating this for <strong>n</strong> years, we add all the values till the last year. Say if 10 years, then we do this calculation 10 times with <strong>n = 1, 2, 3…10</strong>. After this, what we do is very interesting: we multiply the <strong>P/E ratio</strong> with the 10th-year calculation as we want to calculate this for infinite years, then we add that too here, and lastly, we add all the values to get the intrinsic value of the stock. Note here that if this value is more than the stock value, then it is considered a good investment.</p>

        <p><strong>Book Value:</strong> Mathematically, this is <strong>Total assets - Total liabilities</strong>. Book value is how much the investors will get if the company is liquidated. Usually, this is just a value. I don’t see how well this can be used. I think if this is negative, then the investment is risky, but still, one never knows.</p>

        <p><strong>Tangible Book Value:</strong> So tangible is the things that one can physically touch, and here if we have the <strong>tangible assets - liabilities</strong>, then we get the tangible book value. The money the company will be left with if it decides to sell off all the tangible assets to make the liabilities zero. If the company goes bankrupt, then they would have to sell all the assets to make liabilities zero. Here more the tangible book value, the better and safer is the investment.</p>

        <p><strong>Price to Book (P/B) Ratio:</strong> <strong>Current stock price per share / current book value per share</strong>. Basically, it is the market valuation of the company relative to book value. So if the market value is too high compared to the actual value of the company (book value). Usually, the market value is higher than the actual value, but <strong>P/B of 1.0 or lower</strong> is good and a nice investment. Here the <strong>ROE</strong> or <strong>return on equity</strong> comes in handy, as <strong>net income / shareholders equity</strong>, we get the returns on the equity. More the ROE, the better the company is at generating income. Usually, ROE and P/B ratio go hand in hand. So when ROE is high, the P/B is also high. If the P/B is very high but ROE is not very high or even low, then this means that the stock is overvalued in the market and is not a wise investment.</p>

        <p><strong>Earnings per share (EPS):</strong> This is calculated with <strong>net income of the company - preferred dividends</strong>, and then divided by the <strong>total shares</strong>. The Earnings per share is how much the share earns. More the EPS compared to the sector of the stock, the better it is and is considered a good investment.</p>

        <p><strong>Price to Earnings (P/E) Ratio:</strong> <strong>Price per stock / earnings per stock (EPS)</strong>. A high P/E can mean one of the two things: either the company is overvalued (there are other ways to check this) or the investors are expecting high growth returns. There are two ways to use the P/E ratio. First, make sure the stock is not overvalued. Then now, either you can see the historical P/E value and compare it with past years, or you can also compare the P/E ratio with other companies in the same segment.</p>

        <p><strong>Forward P/E Ratio:</strong> How much are the investors willing to pay for future earnings of <strong>1 rs</strong>. This question is answered by the forward P/E ratio. It is the <strong>stock price / forecasted earnings per stock</strong>. The banking sector has a forward P/E of <strong>16</strong> as a good mark, but the healthcare sector <strong>133</strong> is good. Just make sure to see the sector P/E, and also note if we are expecting the earnings to increase, forward P/E will be less than P/E.</p>

        <p><strong>Trailing P/E Ratio:</strong> This is a very absolute and accurate metric. It is the <strong>stock price / past 12-month earnings per share</strong>. Usually, we compare it with the sector P/E. This can also tell us if the company is overvalued or not.</p>

        <p><strong>Price to Earnings Growth (PEG) Ratio:</strong> <strong>PEG = (P/E) / Earnings growth rate</strong>. The earnings growth rate is the <strong>EPS (t) / EPS (t-1) - 1</strong>. So it makes sense that if <strong>PEG > 1</strong>, this means that the stock price is more than the difference in earnings. This just means that the stock is overpriced. The most ideal case is that <strong>PEG = 1</strong>, or the stock price and earnings are correlated. When <strong>PEG < 1</strong>, it is a good time to buy as the stock seems undervalued.</p>

        <p><strong>Price to Sales (P/S) Ratio:</strong> This is how much investors are willing to pay per <strong>1 rs</strong> of sales. This is just the <strong>market capitalisation / sales</strong>. Here one thing to note is that every sector will have a different P/S ratio. Within a sector, say <strong>X</strong> has <strong>0.48 P/S</strong> while <strong>Y</strong> has <strong>0.51</strong>. This means that investors are willing to pay <strong>0.48 rs</strong> for every <strong>1 rs</strong> sales, and this means that <strong>X</strong> is a better investment within the sector as it is more undervalued than <strong>Y</strong>. Usually, <strong>P/E</strong> value less than <strong>1</strong> is considered undervalued and a good investment.</p>

        <p><strong>Price to Cash Flow Ratio (P/CF):</strong> This is an interesting ratio. This ratio is just the <strong>price per stock / net cash flow per stock</strong>. The cash flow is earnings (net income) with non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization. So this means that if a company has a high depreciation expense, then its <strong>P/CF</strong> will be much lower than <strong>P/E</strong>. This is why some people prefer it over <strong>P/E</strong>. Keep in mind that this <strong>P/CF ratio of less than one</strong> is generally a good sign of the stock being undervalued.</p>

        <p><strong>Price to Free Cash Flow (P/FCF):</strong> The <strong>Free cash flow</strong> is the <strong>cash flow - CAPEX (capital expenditure)</strong>. This is good as it reflects actual cash for non-asset growth. Relative to the sector, a lower value means that the stock is undervalued and is a good investment.</p>

        <p><strong>Price to Innovation Ratio:</strong> This is the <strong>market cap upon the R&D spending</strong>. The <strong>R&D</strong> or <strong>Research and Development</strong> is the money spent on research and innovation. A lower value of this ratio compared to the sector value means that the company is investing more in R&D.</p>

        <p><strong>EV/EBITDA:</strong> Okay, so the <strong>EBITDA</strong> is the <strong>operating profit + depreciation + amortisation</strong>. The EV/EBITDA is a better metric than P/E as it has the other components in account and is also tax neutral. A value less than 8 is considered good. Good vale is deepened on the sector average.</p>
